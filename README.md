# Milkdown

![logo](/gh-pages/public/milkdown-mini.svg)

A plugin-driven WYSIWYG markdown Editor, inspired by [Typora](https://typora.io/), built on top of [prosemirror](https://prosemirror.net/) and [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it).

> This project is still working in progress. I'm currently working on
> some core modules to make milkdown can be used out of box.

Here is a [live demo](https://saul-mirone.github.io/milkdown/) for preview.
