# Core

Milkdown core is composed mainly by three parts:

-   Markdown Parser
-   Markdown Serializer
-   Prosemirror

---

## Markdown Parser

> The parser can **transform a markdown string into a prosemirror node tree**.

It is mainly used by transforming the default value, and can be used in features like paste markdown strings.

The parser will parse the markdown strings into ast by [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark),
and transform the ast into the prosemirror node.

## Markdown Serializer

> The serializer can **transform a prosemirror node into a markdown string**.

It is mainly used by listeners, and can be used in features like export to file.
The serializer will parse the prosemirror node tree and transform it into markdown ast,
then the ast can be serialized into markdown string.

## Prosemirror

> Prosemirror is **used for render editor**.

When users interact with the editor, they actually interact with the [prosemirror view instance](https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/#view).

So basically,
a milkdown editor works following these steps:

1. Default value is parsed by parser, generates a node.
2. Node generated by step 1 will be used to create a prosemirror instance.
3. When changes are triggered, the listeners will be called and developers can use serializer to get markdown string.
