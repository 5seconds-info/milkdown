# Serializer

Serializer is used to transform from UI elements to markdown string.

## Transform Steps

The transformation steps are almost opposite to the steps in parser.

1. For the current UI status, there will be a prosemirror node tree to represent it.
2. The prosemirror node tree will be traversed by milkdown serializer. The milkdown serializer is generated by the serializer property of nodes and marks and generate a remark AST as the result.
3. The remark AST will by transformed into markdown string through [remark-stringify](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify).

## Example

For every node, there will be a serializer specification which has the following structure:

```typescript
import { NodeSerializerSpec, Node } from '@milkdown/core';

class MyNode extends Node {
    // other props...
    serializer: NodeSerializerSpec = {
        match: (node) => node.type.name === 'my-node',
        runner: (state, node) => {
            state.openNode('my-node').next(node.content).closeNode();
        },
    };
}
```
